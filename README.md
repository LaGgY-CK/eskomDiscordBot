# eskomDiscordBot
a *nice to have* Discord Bot to notify South African users when there would be loadshedding in their area, sending out an alert x min before it is scheduled.

This integrates with [PolarizedIons/eskom-loadshedding-api](https://github.com/PolarizedIons/eskom-loadshedding-api)

# What is Loadshedding
The deliberate shutdown of electric power in a part or parts of a power-distribution system, generally to prevent the failure of the entire system when the demand strains the capacity of the system.

## Roadmap
- [x] List commands
- [] Display stages to user depending on their Suburb
- [] Check Eskom schedule every x-min
- [] Save user location
- [] Send out Alerts (Schedule changes, Imminent loadshedding in their area)
- [] Other features ?
